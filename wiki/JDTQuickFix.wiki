#JDT quickfix enhancement.

= Introduction =

It's a small tool to enhance the quick fix proposal of JDT.

JDT is a powerful IDE to develop java application. However it's not so intelligent all the time. This tool do some enhancement on JDT to improve my productivity.

All of features of this tool are based on my development favor. 
More intelligent feature might be implemented in future if I find I need one.

= It has =
  * Automatically add "\" to escape characters for string
For example,

Sometime I copy a path in my code from file explorer of Windows, the string looks like "C:\Documents and Settings\kzhu0\My Documents\helios\features\com.ibm.rational.clearcase.ccrc.tours.doc.feature.nl1_7.1.0.v200910291843".

Character "\" used in path need be escaped, I have to fix them one by one in the long string. Now this tool can fix all of them in one mouse click. :)
