= Introduction =

The provisioning and installation management of Eclipse have been into the period of p2. P2 is an intelligent tool to install new plug-ins, update the plug-ins to latest version and manage the dependencies among the different plug-ins. However the eclipse would be heavier and low performance after installing a lot of plug-ins to extend its capability. There is no a good way to configurate eclipse running with different policies to satisfy the different development requirement of users. For example, users want to the eclipse only have C++ development kit and git when doing c/c++ code development. Vice versa, the eclipse only has JDT and Clearcase plug-ins when doing Java development. Loading less plug-ins would improve the performance of eclipse and avoid the conflict among different plug-ins.

So *Advanced Configurator* is an enhancement implementation of bundle manager comparing to the default bundles management of Eclipse(the internal name is simple configurator). This tool is intended to provide a flexible and configurable way to run the single eclipse instance with enabling different plug-ins.
