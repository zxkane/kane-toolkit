#A plug-in import/export the p2 installation to/from configuration file.

= Introduction =

*This feature has been contributed to p2 itself, you can find it in Eclipse Indigo(3.7) M7+ now!*

It's a tool to help quickly replicate the p2 installation to other Eclipse instance.
Eclipse provisioning goes into p2 world from Eclipse 3.4. The classical way to install features/plug-ins is NOT recommended that simply copy them into features/plugins folder. And p2 dev team don't consider it's necessary to support installing features/plugins into external folder.
So there is a lot of manual efforts to 'replicate' the same plug-ins in different Eclipse instance, different workstations or different platforms.

This tool can help simplify the installing effort, just export/import the p2 installation to/from file like preference.

Currently this tool also supports importing from another existing Eclipse instance!
