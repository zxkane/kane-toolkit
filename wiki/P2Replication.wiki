#A plug-in import/export the p2 installation to/from configuration file.

= Introduction =

It's a tool to help quickly replicate the p2 installation to other Eclipse instance.
Eclipse provisioning goes into p2 world from Eclipse 3.4. The classical way to install features/plug-ins is NOT recommended that simply copy them into features/plugins folder. And p2 won't support features/plugins into additional folder.
So there is a lot of manual efforts to 'replicate' the same plug-ins in different Eclipse instance, different workstations or different platforms.
This tool helps simplify the process, just export/import the configuration file like preference.
